  <p>Before beginning make sure to review page 373 in the manual</p>
  <p>(MAINTENANCE - 5. Replacement of objective aperture)</p>

  <p><strong>REMOVAL</strong></p>
  <p><strong> </strong>Things to know: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Once the screws are loosened the aperture will tilt upwards. Make sure to hold to aperture firmly in place while undoing the screws</li>
    <li>The aperture is placed between the PCD (below) and the condenser lens (above) so it must come out as straight as possible</li>
    <li>There is a small pin and metal cylinder that will guide the aperture out. Pay attention to the metal cylinder as once it has slid out there is no more guiding.<img class="pure-img" src="Image_0.jpg" /></li>
  </ol>

  <ol>
    <li>Remove the two screws affixing the aperture to the column<img class="pure-img" src="Image_1.jpg" /></li>
    <li>Slide out carefully and straight. It may help to provide slight upward pressure to get yourself started. It also may help to brace your arm against the top of the specimen chamber. Good luck!</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>DISASSEMBLY </strong></p>
  <p><strong> NOTE: You can do this procedure while the aperture is in the microscope as long as you are careful to not rotate or jostle the aperture assembly</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Put on gloves</li>
    <li>Remove the aperture plate (with foil and spring leaf attached) using the two screws (Screw B) which connect the aperture plate and clutch assembly</li>
    <ol>
      <li>Touch the aperture plate assembly and screws as little as possible and place somewhere safe<img class="pure-img" src="Image_2.png" /></li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>STEPS TO UNSTICK X-APERTURE KNOB</strong></p>
    <li>Remove the x-aperture knob by unscrewing </li>
  </ol>
  <p><img class="pure-img"src="Image_3.png" /></p>

  <li>Remove top and side flat head screws (there will be a spring inside each). Place caps to one side noting which belongs to which hole (one is shorter). If the spring pops out leave </li>
  </ol>
  <p>it with its respective cap. <img class="pure-img" src="Image_4.jpg" /></p>


  <li>Remove the two screws from the top semicircle </li>
  <li>Never undo the bottom two screws especially if disassembling with the aperture in the microscope as removing the screws will allow for the aperture assembly to rotate too far</li>
  </ol>
  <p><img class="pure-img" src="Image_5.jpg" /></p>
  <li>Remove the upper semicircle along with any remaining springs and the white stopper from the top screw hole</li>
  </ol>
  <p><img class="pure-img" src="Image_6.jpg" /></p>
  <li>Using a rubber tool push out the metal cylinder (inside the x-aperture hole) </li>
  <li>Once removed clean and reapply grease (this part does not see high vacuum)</li>
  <li>Reassemble metal semicircle and all attachments</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>STEPS TO DISASSEMBLE CLUTCH </strong></p>
  <li>Remove screw embedded in y-aperture knob<img class="pure-img" src="Image_7.jpg" /></li>
  <li>Remove y-aperture knob by unscrewing</li>
  <li>Note the number of turns to unscrew so it can be rescrewed in the same amount<img class="pure-img" src="Image_8.jpg" /></li>
  </ol>
